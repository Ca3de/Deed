## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 4 Weeks)
1. **Implement Transactions** - Blocking for production
2. **Implement Security basics** - Auth + encryption
3. **Implement Aggregations** - Users need COUNT/SUM/AVG

### Short-term (Weeks 5-8)
4. Implement Joins (INNER, LEFT)
5. Implement B-tree indexes
6. Implement Backup/restore

### Medium-term (Weeks 9-12)
7. Full-text search
8. Triggers
9. Views
10. Connection pooling

### Skip (Not Needed)
- OLAP features (use external tools)
- In-database ML (use libraries)
- Advanced replication (start with simple)

## Summary

**Current State**:
- Strong foundation (DQL, CRUD, schemas, optimization)
- Missing critical production features (transactions, security, aggregations)

**Gap to Production**:
- 🔴 Transactions: **CRITICAL** (4 weeks)
- 🔴 Security: **CRITICAL** (2 weeks)
- 🔴 Aggregations: **CRITICAL** (1 week)
- 🟡 Joins: **HIGH** (1 week)
- 🟡 Indexes: **HIGH** (1 week)

**Total to Production**: ~9-10 weeks of focused development

**Unique Advantages**:
- ✅ Unified query language (no other DB has this!)
- ✅ Biological optimization (world-class!)
- ✅ Hybrid relational+graph (unique combination!)

Deed has a **strong unique value proposition**, just needs standard DB features to be production-ready.
